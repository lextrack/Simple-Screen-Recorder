<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">
Simple Screen Recorder is a tool that allows users to record their screen activity and audio. Here are instructions on how to use the Simple Screen Recorder to create screen recordings and audio recordings.
</p>

<h2 align="center">How to use it?</h2>
<p align="center">

- In the main screen recording window, select the **audio input device** that you want to use to record the audio track from the "Microphone (Mic/Aux)" dropdown menu.<br>

- Select the **audio output device** that you want to use to record the audio track from the "System sound (Desktop Audio)" dropdown menu.<br>

- Select the **codec** that you want to use from the "Encoder" dropdown menu. The available codecs are "MPEG-4", "H264 NVENC (Nvidia Graphics Cards)" and "H264 AMF (AMD Graphics Cards)".<br>

- Select the **file format** that you want to use from the "File Format" dropdown menu. The available formats are "MKV" and "AVI". I recommend using AVI.<br>

- Select the **framerate** that you want to use from the "Video framerate" dropdown menu. You can record a video at 30 or 60 fps.<br>

- Select the **monitor** that you want to record from the "Monitor selector" dropdown menu.<br>

- If you check the "Capture all monitors" option, the app is going to record a video with all the monitors connected to the PC.<br>

- Use the radio buttons to select whether you want to record the audio from both the microphone and desktop audio.<br>

- Click the "Start Recording" button to begin the screen recording process. The screen recording will begin and the timer in the lower left corner of the window will start counting up.<br>

- To stop the screen recording, click the "Stop Recording" button. The recorded video file will be saved in the "Recordings" folder.<br>

- When you enter the "Recordings" folder, you'll see the audio and video files separated. Having the files like this is very useful if you want to edit the video and audio tracks with total freedom. However, you also can combine/merge your audio and video files using the "Media Merge" tool. All the merged files will be saved in the "Output Files" folder.<br>

- You can also record audio separately. You can record your microphone, desktop audio, or both separately. 
Select the Audio Recording option in the main window and you can record audio from your PC. The recorded audio files are stored in the "Audio Recordings" folder.<br>
