<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">
Simple Screen Recorder is a tool that allows users to record their screen activity and audio. Here comes instructions on how to use the Simple Screen Recorder to create screen recordings.
</p>

<h2 align="center">How to use?</h2>
<p align="center">

- In the main screen recording window, select the **audio input device** that you want to use to record the audio track from the "Microphone (Mic/Aux)" dropdown menu.<br>

- Select the **audio output device** that you want to use to record the audio track from the "System sound (Desktop Audio)" dropdown menu.<br>

- Select the **codec** that you want to use from the "Encoder" dropdown menu. The available codecs are "MPEG-4" and "H264 NVENC (Nvidia Graphics Cards)".<br>

- Select the **resolution** that you want to use from the "Resolution" dropdown menu. Available resolutions include "1920x1080", "1600x900", "1536x864", "1366x768", "1360x768", "1280x720", and "1024x768". (This selector always will take your primary monitor. Sometimes, you must adjust you current resolution in the app.)<br>

- Use the radio buttons to select whether you want to record the audio from both the microphone and desktop Audio, just the microphone, or just the desktop Audio.<br>

- Click the "Start Recording" button to begin the screen recording process. The screen recording will begin and the timer in the lower left corner of the window will start counting up.<br>
